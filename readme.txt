Nibble's automated & entertaining negotiation has proven to more than double conversion rates, measurably improve customer engagement and increase AOVs, all while saving margin and clearing stock.

Each month, Nibble chats with 25K+ users in the US, Europe & Asia handling 500+ hours of negotiations, winning baskets which would otherwise be abandoned.

A flexible, engaging solution that does everything variable pricing and make an offer tools do – and more.

= How Nibble Works =
After you install the Wordpress plugin, enter your credentials and you are ready to go:

1. Login to our admin Panel and set rules for when and on which products Nibble should appear. These can be razor targeted, e.g. based on exit intents or user behaviour. You can also activate Nibble with magic links for email campaigns, or for a limited time for flash sales.

2. The Nibble chatbot appears based on these rules, allowing the user to start an engaging and fun conversation about price by making an offer.

3. Once a price is agreed, the user checks out as normal – and smiles! Simple as that.

= What does Nibble let you do? =

- **Accept offers at scale with automation**
You tell Nibble what discount you're willing to give and it handles the rest for you, including accepting offers and issuing discounts. No manual labour needed.

- **Get smarter at pricing and stop leaving money on the table**
Find out what price works best for shoppers through real customer insights

- **Clear stock year-round without waiting for sale seasons**
